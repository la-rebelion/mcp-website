Unlike prompts, Skills define explicit boundaries, permissions, and execution rules that machines can enforce."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"How do Agent Skills differ from prompts?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Prompts are implicit natural language suggestions with trust-based, non-deterministic behavior. Skills are explicit structured capabilities with contract-based, auditable, and governable execution. Prompts decide what to try; Skills define what is allowed."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What's the difference between Skills, tools, and workflows?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Tools are low-level primitives, workflows are pre-wired sequences, and Skills are bounded capabilities that agents choose to invoke. Skills sit at the decision boundary between reasoning and execution."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Why do AI agents need Skills instead of just prompts?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Prompt-driven agents don't scale at enterprise level. They can hallucinate actions, have implicit permissions, opaque execution paths, and are impossible to audit. Skills provide the control, governance, and security that enterprises demand."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What role does MCP play with Agent Skills?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides a transport-agnostic execution layer for Skills, enabling remote skill invocation, enterprise security boundaries, air-gap compatibility, and audit/governance hooks. MCP turns Skills from ideas into infrastructure."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Are Agent Skills becoming a standard?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Yes. What started as framework-specific abstractions is converging into shared specifications, common schemas, public registries, installation tooling, and usage tracking. Skills are becoming the standard unit of agent execution, governance, and enterprise adoption."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Can Agent Skills be audited for security?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Yes. Unlike prompts, Skills are structured with explicit schemas, making them auditable and governable. They provide clear artifacts for security reviews, permission tracking, and execution path analysis."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Where do Agent Skills execute?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Skills don't live in the model\u2014they live in systems. The model handles reasoning, while Skills execute in controlled environments with proper security boundaries and governance. This separation ensures authority stays with the system, not the AI."}}]},d=[];function u(e){const t={p:"p",strong:"strong",...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(r.A,{children:(0,a.jsx)("script",{type:"application/ld+json",children:JSON.stringify(p)})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"AI agents are getting smarter \u2014 and more dangerous."})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Not because they reason better, but because they act without boundaries."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Agent Skills exist to fix that."})})]})}function g(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},8453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>o});var n=i(6540);const a={},s=n.createContext(a);function r(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:r(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
