AI agents are getting smarter — and more dangerous.

Not because they reason better, but because they act without boundaries.

Agent Skills exist to fix that.

<!-- truncate -->

They define **what an agent can do**, **how it can do it**, and **under what constraints** — in a way machines can enforce, not humans hope for.

---

## A simple definition

An **Agent Skill** is a structured, declarative capability that an AI agent may invoke to perform an action through a system.

Not a suggestion.  
Not a prompt.  
A capability with rules.

---

## Why Skills became inevitable

Prompt-driven agents don’t scale.

At small scale, prompts feel powerful.  
At system scale, they create risk:

- Agents hallucinate actions
- Permissions are implicit
- Execution paths are opaque
- Security reviews are impossible
- Audits have no artifacts

Skills emerged because **enterprises demanded control**.

The industry responded with:
- A shared **Skill specification**
- Standard schemas
- Registries and catalogs
- Installation, discovery, and tracking mechanisms

Skills are now appearing everywhere — frameworks, runtimes, marketplaces, and dashboards.

---

## Skills vs prompts (the real difference)

| Prompts | Skills |
|------|------|
| Implicit behavior | Explicit capability |
| Natural language | Structured schema |
| Trust-based | Contract-based |
| Hard to audit | Auditable |
| Non-deterministic | Governable |

Prompts decide *what to try*.  
Skills define *what is allowed*.

---

## Skills vs tools vs workflows

This is where confusion happens.

- **Tools** are low-level primitives
- **Workflows** are pre-wired sequences
- **Skills** are bounded capabilities that agents choose to invoke

Skills sit at the **decision boundary** between reasoning and execution.

That’s why they matter.

---

## Skills are becoming a standard layer

What started as framework-specific abstractions is now converging:

- Shared specifications
- Common schemas
- Public registries
- Installation and discovery tooling
- Usage tracking and observability

This is how ecosystems form.

Not around models — but around **capabilities**.

---

## Why MCP matters for Skills

Skills don’t live in the model.

They live in systems.

MCP provides:
- A transport-agnostic execution layer
- Remote skill invocation
- Enterprise security boundaries
- Air-gap compatibility
- Audit and governance hooks

MCP turns Skills from ideas into infrastructure.

---

## The mental model to remember

> Reasoning stays with the model.  
> Authority stays with the system.

Skills are where that line is drawn.

---

## What comes next

Skills are now the unit of:
- Agent execution
- Platform governance
- Security review
- Enterprise adoption

The rest of this section explores how to design, build, evaluate, deploy, and govern them — **as systems**, not demos.
