What is the moral message of [Brian Casel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo168H2m5lw) about the future of SDKs, no-code workflows, and automation?

<!-- truncate -->

Brian Casel, a well-known developer and entrepreneur, shared his experience building an AI-powered image generation automation. He spent a full week building a complex automation in n8n (a popular no-code workflow engine) for AI image generation — but ultimately scrapped it and rebuilt the entire thing as a Claude Code Skill instead. His conclusion: *Claude Code Skills are better suited for flexible, maintainable, and powerful automations than traditional no-code workflows for many use cases*.

## The Death of SDKs

In the age of Agentic AI, traditional Software Development Kits (SDKs) are becoming increasingly obsolete. SDKs, which provide a set of tools and libraries for building applications, are rigid and require extensive coding to handle various scenarios. As Brian Casel demonstrated, automations built with SDKs or no-code platforms like [n8n](https://n8n.io/) can become complex, brittle, and hard to maintain.

Agentic AI with [Claude Code Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview), on the other hand, allows developers to define high-level goals and constraints, letting the AI reason and adapt dynamically. This shift from static (deterministic) code to intelligent reasoning means that applications can evolve and respond to new challenges without the need for constant manual updates.

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) did it again, similar to how they revolutionized the AI-API landscape with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and MCP Servers, they are now pioneering the way we build automations and applications with [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io).

## Embracing Agentic AI with Agent Skills

To leverage the power of Agentic AI, developers should focus on:

1. **Goal-Oriented Design**: Define what the application should achieve rather than how to achieve it step-by-step. This allows the AI to determine the best course of action.
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Utilize AI's ability to adapt to new inputs and scenarios, reducing the need for hard-coded logic and extensive conditionals.
3. **Continuous Learning**: Implement feedback loops where the AI can learn from its actions and improve over time, enhancing the application's performance and reliability.
4. **Integration with AI Services**: Leverage existing AI platforms and services that offer agentic capabilities, reducing the need to build complex systems from scratch.
5. **Focus on User Experience**: With AI handling the complexity, developers can concentrate on creating intuitive and engaging user experiences.

### AI Services Examples

* **Agent Skills**: As demonstrated by Brian Casel, Claude Code Skills allow for building flexible automations that can adapt to changing requirements without extensive rewrites.
  * Check the [mcp.com.ai skills](https://skills.sh/?q=mcp-com-ai) examples replacing complex SDK-based automations with Skills, such as:
    * [API To MCP](https://skills.sh/mcp-com-ai/mcp-server-evaluations-skills/mcp-server-evaluations) - Automating the conversion of REST APIs and deployment of those into MCP Servers.
    * [Test Remote MCPs](https://skills.sh/mcp-com-ai/mcp-server-evaluations-skills/mcp-server-evaluations) - Automating the testing of remote MCP servers without writing SDK code, and with no dependency on specific programming languages.
  * Community-built Skills for various tasks, including:  
    * Automating content generation workflows
    * Dynamic data processing pipelines
    * Intelligent customer support systems
* **Code Copilots**: An AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
  * **Custom AI Agents**: Tailored AI agents that can perform specific tasks or workflows, adapting to user needs dynamically. Examples:
    * The `HAPI MCP Visual Identity System Agent`, which helps maintain and enhance visual identity systems. Based on the Brian's example, users can create visual assets dynamically without rigid templates.
    * [VS Code AI Agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents) that assist developers in code generation, debugging, and optimization.
* **AI-Powered APIs, a.k.a. MCP Servers**: APIs that leverage AI to provide intelligent responses and actions, reducing the need for complex SDKs.

## The Future is Agentic

The future of application development lies in embracing Agentic AI. As traditional SDKs become less relevant, any person building software (developers or non-developers) must adapt to this new paradigm by focusing on high-level goals, dynamic adaptation, and continuous learning. By doing so, they can build smarter, more resilient applications that can evolve with changing needs and challenges.

Creating systems that can think and adapt on their own is the key to unlocking new possibilities not only in software development but across various industries, and specialized domains. Desing, adapt, learn, integrate, and evolve—these principles of Agentic AI will drive the next generation of applications. Agility, innovation, and flexibility will be the cornerstones of successful applications in the age of Agentic AI.

This process is a clear indicator that the era of rigid SDKs is coming to an end. The future belongs to those who can harness the power of Agentic AI to create flexible, intelligent systems that can think and adapt on their own.

## Conclusion

Don't get me wrong—SDKs are not entirely dead yet, probably not for another decade or so. They still have their place in certain scenarios, especially for low-level system programming or when performance is critical, i.e., game development, embedded systems, enterprise software with strict compliance needs, etcetera. However, for many modern applications, especially those requiring flexibility and adaptability, Agentic AI with Agent Skills offers a superior alternative.

Teams and developers should take away the importance of embracing new technologies and paradigms that can enhance productivity and innovation. By shifting focus from rigid SDKs to dynamic, goal-oriented AI systems, people can unlock new possibilities and create applications that are more responsive to user needs.

Rebels, take note: the future is agentic, and it's time to adapt.  
Be HAPI, and Go Rebels! ✊🏼
