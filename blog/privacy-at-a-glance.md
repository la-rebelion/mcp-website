## TL;DR

- Self-hosted and air-gapped deployments keep **100% control**
- Minimal cookies are used to improve the product
- Using the platform means you agree to these practices

## What Data We Collect (Minimal by Design)

We collect **only what we need** to run and improve the service:

- Account information (email, name, organization)
- Basic technical metadata (IP, runtime, timestamps)
- Optional feedback or support communications

We **do not** collect:
- MCP prompts or tool payloads by default
- API business data
- Customer secrets or credentials
- Model training data from your usage

## MCP & Agent Data Handling

**By default:**
- MCP requests are processed **in-memory**
- No prompt or tool execution data is stored
- No MCP data is used for analytics or training

**Optional & configurable (you decide):**
- Logging
- Tracing
- Observability
- A/B testing for internal APIs

For **on-premise and air-gapped deployments**, La Rebelion Labs has **no access** to your MCP traffic.
