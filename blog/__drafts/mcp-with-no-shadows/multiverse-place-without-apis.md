Hello Rebels!

In this post, we will explore an ideal scenario for MCP, not "Multiverse Control Plane" but "Model Context Plane," let's travel to a parallel universe where where we don't have APIs at all.

## The Multiverse Place Without APIs

Imagine a world where applications need to interact with each other, but there are no APIs to facilitate this communication, well, there is no OAS or Swagger defined yet. This smart traveler from our universe present the idea of MCP to this new world. Whoa! They are amazed by the concept of MCP, which allows different applications to communicate seamlessly.

In this universe, AI and developers still work in silos, the multiverse traveler introduces some document specifications that the developers can use to understand how to interact with the systems. The developers can build applications that leverage the capabilities of other systems without needing to understand their internal workings.

## Code With No Shadows

In this universe, the specifications provided by the multiverse traveler serve as the single source of truth for how systems should interact. There is no risk of shadow code because there is single implementation of the logic that governs the interactions between systems, allowing the systems to communicate and share data without duplicating logic or creating drift of the business rules.

Instead of shadow code, starting from scratch, the developers or the AI can focus on building robust and reliable applications that leverage the capabilities of other systems, leading to a more efficient and effective multiverse. A system can consume the capabilities of another system without needing to re-implement the logic that governs those capabilities. The AI, also can consume the specifications to understand how to interact with the systems, leading to more accurate and reliable results.

The Green Field of MCP without APIs is a world where systems can communicate seamlessly without the risk of shadow code. By leveraging specifications as the single source of truth, developers and AI can build applications that are efficient, effective, and reliable.

## Conclusion

In this ideal scenario, both, APIs and MCP servers at the same time, can coexist without the risk of shadow code. By leveraging a single source of truth of the business rules, developers and AI can build applications that are efficient, effective, and reliable, leading to a more connected and collaborative multiverse.
