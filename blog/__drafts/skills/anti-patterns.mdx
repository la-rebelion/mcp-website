## The fastest ways to break trust in agent systems

Skills are supposed to make agent systems **safe, testable, and governable**.

These anti-patterns do the opposite:
they turn Skills into **prompt glue**, **shadow code**, and **un-auditable automation**.

Use this page as a checklist before you ship anything.

## 1) Prompt = Policy

**What it looks like**
- “We’ll just tell the agent not to do bad things.”
- “The prompt says: don’t touch prod.”
- “We’ll rely on system messages for compliance.”

**Why it breaks**
- Prompts are not enforceable.
- Prompts drift.
- Prompts are not auditable controls.

**Do this instead**
- Put policy in the **Skill contract**:
  - validation
  - authorization
  - constraints
  - safe defaults
  - explicit failure modes

---

## 2) Agent Calls APIs Directly

**What it looks like**
- The agent has raw API keys.
- The agent can hit internal endpoints without guardrails.
- “It’s fine, we trust the model.”

**Why it breaks**
- You lose least privilege.
- You expose sensitive surfaces.
- Failures become unpredictable and expensive.

**Do this instead**
- Wrap risky actions into Skills.
- Make the Skill the only boundary that touches systems.

---

## 3) Skill That Does “Everything”

**What it looks like**
- `manage_customer()`
- `do_all_the_things()`
- One Skill that mutates many systems.

**Why it breaks**
- Not testable.
- Hard to reason about.
- Impossible to govern and approve.

**Do this instead**
- Skills should represent **one capability**.
- Prefer small Skills with clear contracts and stable outputs.

---

## 4) Endpoint Thinking (Not Capability Thinking)

**What it looks like**
- One Skill per API endpoint.
- Leaking internal API structure into the Skill surface.

**Why it breaks**
- Too many Skills.
- No intent alignment.
- Agents become “API clients,” not capability users.

**Do this instead**
- Map multiple endpoints into one capability.
- Expose outcomes, not plumbing.

---

## 5) Non-Deterministic Skills

**What it looks like**
- The Skill calls an LLM internally and returns free-text.
- The Skill’s output shape changes.
- The Skill “guesses” missing inputs.

**Why it breaks**
- Skills are supposed to be the deterministic edge.
- You can’t regression test.
- You can’t guarantee safety.

**Do this instead**
- Skills should return **structured outputs**.
- If you must use an LLM internally, constrain it:
  - fixed schema
  - strict validation
  - bounded behaviors
  - deterministic fallbacks

---

## 6) Hidden Side Effects

**What it looks like**
- A “read” Skill that also updates records.
- A “preview” Skill that triggers real actions.
- Side effects without explicit consent.

**Why it breaks**
- Surprises kill trust.
- You can’t safely simulate or evaluate.
- Auditors will flag it.

**Do this instead**
- Make side effects explicit in:
  - name
  - description
  - inputs
  - return values
- Separate “preview” vs “apply” Skills.

---

## 7) Weak Error Contracts

**What it looks like**
- `500: something went wrong`
- Exceptions with no typed structure
- “Just retry until it works”

**Why it breaks**
- Agents need predictable failures.
- Retries can cause duplicates and cost spikes.
- Operations becomes chaos.

**Do this instead**
- Define error shapes:
  - `INVALID_INPUT`
  - `NOT_AUTHORIZED`
  - `NOT_FOUND`
  - `RATE_LIMITED`
  - `DEPENDENCY_FAILURE`
- Provide safe, actionable messages.

---

## 8) No Idempotency

**What it looks like**
- “Create payment” can run twice.
- “Provision user” duplicates accounts.
- Retries create multiple side effects.

**Why it breaks**
- Agents retry.
- Networks fail.
- Without idempotency, your system becomes unsafe.

**Do this instead**
- Add idempotency keys.
- Make Skills safe to retry.
- Return consistent receipts and references.

---

## 9) No Versioning Strategy

**What it looks like**
- Breaking changes without warning
- Agents suddenly failing
- Old workflows silently misbehaving

**Why it breaks**
- Skills are contracts.
- Contracts must be stable across time.

**Do this instead**
- Version Skills explicitly.
- Keep backward compatibility where possible.
- Provide deprecation windows and migration guides.

---

## 10) “Shadow Skills” Outside Governance

**What it looks like**
- Teams publish Skills from laptops
- No reviews, no audit trails, no ownership
- Ad-hoc Skill servers on random infra

**Why it breaks**
- This is Shadow IT with more risk.
- It creates hidden capability surfaces.
- It breaks compliance and platform trust.

**Do this instead**
- Require:
  - ownership metadata
  - approval flows
  - registries/catalogs
  - observability
  - lifecycle policies

---

## Quick Pre-Ship Checklist

Before shipping a Skill, confirm:

- ✅ Capability is clear and narrow
- ✅ Inputs are validated
- ✅ Outputs are structured
- ✅ Errors are typed and predictable
- ✅ Side effects are explicit
- ✅ Idempotency exists
- ✅ Authorization is least-privilege
- ✅ Logging/auditing is in place
- ✅ Versioning and deprecation plan exists

---

## Bottom Line

Agents are powerful.  
But **trust** is what makes them deployable.

Trust does not come from prompts.  
It comes from Skills that behave like contracts. 
Skills that are designed for safety, reliability, and governance.

Get Skills right, and you get agents that survive reality.
