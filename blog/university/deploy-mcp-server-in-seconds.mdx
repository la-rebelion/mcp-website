Setting up a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server is easier than you might think! It is a straightforward process that doesn't require extensive DevOps skills. Whether you're testing, packaging, or scaling globally, the **HAPI MCP Stack** equips you with everything you need to launch your server in just seconds.

In this guide, we'll explore **4 different ways** to run and deploy MCP servers using the HAPI CLI.

**Bonus:** Agent Skills provided to automate MCP server deployment.

## 1. Local Development (The Quickest Way)

For rapid iteration and testing, running your MCP server locally is the best approach. You can instantly spin up a server and inspect its tools using the official MCP Inspector.

In this example, we'll run an **OpenAI Tools** server.

```bash
# Run the MCP Server Locally and pipe to Inspector
hapi serve openai-tools \
  --headless \
  --port 3030 \
  --url https://api.openai.com/v1 | bunx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Find more MCP server definitions in the official [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/?q=ai.com.mcp).

### What's happening here?
- `hapi serve`: Starts the MCP server.
- `--headless`: Runs without a UI (optimized for machine interaction).
- `--port 3030`: Binds the server to port 3030.
- `| bunx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`: Pipes the output directly to the MCP Inspector, allowing you to interact with your tools in a web interface locally.

## 2. Docker Containers (The Portable Way)

If you need to ship your server to Kubernetes, ECS, or any container orchestration platform, Docker is the industry standard. We provide a pre-built image `hapimcp/hapi-cli` that is ready to serve.

```bash
docker run --name hapi-openai -d \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  hapimcp/hapi-cli:latest serve \
  --openapi https://docs.mcp.com.ai/servers-apis/openapi/openai-tools.yaml \
  --headless \
  --url https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### Breakdown:
- `hapimcp/hapi-cli:latest`: The official HAPI CLI Docker image.
- `--openapi ...`: Specifies the OpenAPI definition for the server (defining the tools/resources).
- `-p 3030:3030`: Maps the container port to your host.

Your server is now running in a container, ready to accept connections on port 3030!

## 3. Cloudflare Workers (The Scalable Way)

For a serverless solution with global low latency, **Cloudflare Workers** is the ultimate deployment target. HAPI CLI handles the entire build and deployment process for you.

```bash
hapi deploy --name openai-tools \
  --project openai \
  --openapi https://docs.mcp.com.ai/servers-apis/openapi/openai-tools.yaml \
  --url https://api.openai.com/v1
```

You'll see output like this:

```text
📝 Generating temporary Wrangler config...
⚙️ Deploying to Cloudflare Workers...
🌍 Live at: https://openai-tools.runmcp.workers.dev
✅ Deployed successfully!
```

### Why Cloudflare Workers?
- **Zero Cold Starts:** Instant response times.
- **Global Distribution:** Deployed to 300+ cities worldwide.
- **Cost Effective:** Pay only for what you use.

## 4. Fly.io (The Global Way)

For those who prefer running on **Fly.io**, you can deploy your MCP server instantly using our pre-built image, bypassing the need for Dockerfiles or complex overrides.

```bash
fly machine run hapimcp/hapi-cli:latest --command "hapi serve" \
  -e openapi="https://docs.mcp.com.ai/servers-apis/openapi/openai-tools.yaml" \
  -e url="https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

### Why Fly.io?
- **Instant Machines:** Boot full VM instances in milliseconds.
- **Global Anycast:** Run close to your users.
- **Pre-built Image:** No build step required—just run.

## Agent Skills to Automate Deployment

To make deployment even easier, we provide **Agent Skills** that automate the entire process of deploying MCP servers across different platforms. You can find this and more skills in the [mcp.com.ai skills registry](https://skills.sh/?q=mcp-com-ai).

<!-- Quick install command -->
```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/mcp-com-ai/api-to-mcp-skills --skill api-to-mcp
```
