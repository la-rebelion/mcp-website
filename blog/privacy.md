# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** March 21, 2025

La Rebelion Labs ("**La Rebelion Labs**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") operates the **HAPI MCP Stack** and related services available at [https://mcp.com.ai](https://mcp.com.ai) (the "**Service**").

Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains **what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have** when using the HAPI MCP Stack.

We design our products with **privacy-by-default**, **minimal data collection**, and **developer control** as core principles.

---

- HAPI MCP Server deployments (cloud and on-premise)  
- Websites, dashboards, CLIs, APIs, and documentation hosted under `mcp.com.ai`  
- Any related services provided by La Rebelion Labs  

This policy **does not** apply to third-party services or MCP servers not operated by us.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect **only what is necessary** to operate, secure, and improve the Service.

### 2.1 Information You Provide Directly

You may voluntarily provide:

- Name or username  
- Email address

### 2.3 MCP, API, and Tooling Data

Important clarification:

- **We do not inspect, store, or train on MCP payloads, prompts, or tool execution data by default.**
- API requests and MCP tool calls are processed **ephemerally** unless logging is explicitly enabled by you.
- Any logging, tracing, or telemetry is **configurable and opt-in**, especially for enterprise or self-hosted users.

For on-premise and air-gapped deployments, **all data remains fully under your control**.

---

## 3. How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

- Operate and maintain the Service  
- Authenticate users and secure access  
- Provide support and respond to requests  
- Improve reliability, performance, and developer experience  
- Comply with legal obligations  

We **do not sell personal data** and **do not use your data for advertising**.

---

## 4. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)

Where applicable, we process personal data based on:

- **Consent** – when you explicitly provide data  
- **Contractual necessity** – to deliver the Service  
- **Legitimate interests** – security, reliability, and fraud prevention

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share limited data only when necessary:

All vendors are selected with **security and compliance** in mind.

- Essential functionality

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal data only as long as necessary:

- Account data: for the lifetime of the account  
- Support communications: as needed for follow-up and auditing

Self-hosted and air-gapped deployments control their own retention policies.
