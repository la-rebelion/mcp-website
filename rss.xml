            <description><![CDATA[An overview of threats and misleadings related to prompt injection in the context of MCP (Model Context Protocol).]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prompt injection is a critical security risk for any system using large language models (LLMs), including those built with Model Context Protocol (MCP). You must understand how prompt injection works, why MCP cannot prevent it, and what steps you should take to protect your users and applications (MCP Clients).</p>

<p>MCP enables users and clients to discover and pull prompts from MCP Servers. This flexibility means you, as a client developer, are responsible for validating and sanitizing all user inputs before they reach the LLM. MCP Clients act as intermediaries between MCP Servers, end users, and LLMs. If you do not implement proper validation, malicious prompts can reach the LLM and cause harmful or unintended outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Key Roles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Developer:</strong> You build MCP Clients and must implement security and validation.</li>
<li><strong>MCP Client:</strong> Your app acts as an intermediary, handling prompt delivery and user input forwarding.</li>
<li><strong>End User:</strong> Users interact with LLMs via MCP Clients and may provide inputs that could be exploited.</li>
<li><strong>LLM:</strong> Processes prompts and user inputs, vulnerable to prompt injection if upstream validation is insufficient.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="threats">Threats<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/mcp-threats-prompt-injection#threats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Threats" title="Direct link to Threats" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Prompt injection can lead to several serious risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malicious Prompts:</strong> Attackers craft prompts to manipulate the LLM into generating harmful or unintended outputs (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a>).</li>
<li><strong>User Input Manipulation:</strong> End users may input data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the LLM's response generation (<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Data Leakage:</strong> Sensitive information may be exposed through manipulated prompts or responses (<a href="https://airmf.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST AI RMF</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Misleading outputs generated by LLMs due to prompt injection can harm your application's reputation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid these misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>False Sense of Security:</strong> MCP does not provide inherent protection against prompt injection. You must implement your own safeguards.</li>
<li><strong>Overreliance on LLMs:</strong> LLMs do not automatically handle all types of inputs safely. Validation is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Misunderstanding Roles:</strong> Security measures must be implemented in the MCP Client, not just the server or LLM.</li>
<li><strong>Assumption of Trustworthiness:</strong> Do not trust all prompts from third-party MCP Servers. Use official or self-hosted servers when possible (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Neglecting Client Responsibility:</strong> Input validation is your responsibility as the MCP Client developer.</li>

<p>Follow these best practices to reduce prompt injection risks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Check all user inputs for malicious content before forwarding to the LLM (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Remove or neutralize potentially harmful elements in user inputs.</li>
<li><strong>User Education:</strong> Inform users about prompt injection risks and safe input practices.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Audit your MCP Client regularly to identify and fix vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Track interactions and flag suspicious activities for review.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[Exploring the potential of OpenAPI Specification (OAS) v4 for AI tool integration and how it can complement Model Context Protocol (MCP).]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>🚨 "OpenAPI Specification (OAS) v4 is out" - <em>That I wish</em>, this is the kind of headline I would expect to see soon, because OAS can easily be extended to enable RESTful APIs work seamlessly with AI.</p>
<p>By the end of this article, you'll know how to let any LLM call your REST tools automatically using OAS.</p>
<p><strong>What Does It Mean for AI Tool Integration?</strong> Let's explore how OAS v4 could fit into the AI landscape, complementing protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP).</p>

OAS v4 is not yet released, and this article is not endorsed by the OpenAPI Initiative or any other organization.</p></div></div>
<p>Over the past decade, OAS has become the standard for describing RESTful APIs and is widely adopted across various industries. Now, it's time to expand it to cover AI use cases, addressing the evolving needs of developers.</p>
<p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) has recently gained a lot of attention. It's great for local integrations, allows you to adjust the MCP server for backend connections, and with the latest updates, it can now handle remote calls, moving closer to RESTful APIs.</p>
<p>Since the beginning <a href="https://rebelion.la/model-context-protocol-mcp-is-it-a-protocol-or-a-contract#heading-the-lsp-connection-understanding-mcps-roots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCP was designed for local integrations mainly</a>. The breakthrough of MCP lies in its <strong>ability to let the LLM discover the tools available</strong>. This tool discovery feature marks MCP's unique value proposition, transforming the way we approach AI integrations. From there, everything falls into place similar to RESTful APIs: the client acts as a lightweight orchestration layer, the server handles the backend tasks, and the LLM plays the role of the brain, deciding which tools to use and how to use them.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-mcp-work-for-mere-mortals">How does MCP work? For mere mortals<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/oas-v4-is-out#how-does-mcp-work-for-mere-mortals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does MCP work? For mere mortals" title="Direct link to How does MCP work? For mere mortals" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I have noticed that many people struggle to understand how MCP works, so let me try to explain it in a simple way.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a conversation between the client (you), the LLM (a friend), and the server (weather guy):</p>
<p>Setting the scene: you have a person (the MCP Server) who speaks a language you don't understand, such as French, and you have a friend who speaks both languages (The LLM), French and English. You'd like to know the weather in Paris, so you can ask your friend for help. Your friend asks the person in French, gets the answer, and translates it back to you in English. In this scenario, your friend represents the LLM supporting tool calling natively.</p>
<p>Now, imagine you can write in French but don't speak it fluently. You'd like to know the weather in Paris, but this time you need someone to guide you on what to ask in French. You write the message asking for the weather. Once you receive the answer, you can translate it without help. This scenario reflects the role of an LLM that doesn't support tool calling natively, and the client has to call the tool directly.</p>
<p>Complex, right? Let's see it in a sequence diagram:</p>
<!-- -->
<p>The LLM receives a prompt with a description of the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#listing-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available tools</a>. This tool list can be <a href="https://rebelion.la/you-dont-need-to-implement-mcp-servers-a-contract-first-approach-to-ai-tool-integration?showSharer=true#heading-example-conversion-openapi-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mapped from the OpenAPI spec</a>. The LLM then chooses which tool to use and how to use it. The client simply passes the user input to the LLM, which decides what to do next. Some LLMs, like GPT-4-turbo and Llama2, support tool calling natively. Others, like Claude, do not, so the client calls the tool directly, based on the LLM's instruction.</p>
<p>As you can see, either the LLM supports tool calling natively or not, the flow is similar. The only difference is that in the latter case, the client does the call to the server, and forwards the response to the LLM to get the final result for the end-user - based on the LLM's instruction.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oas-v4---the-missing-piece">OAS v4 - The missing piece<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/oas-v4-is-out#oas-v4---the-missing-piece" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OAS v4 - The missing piece" title="Direct link to OAS v4 - The missing piece" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The missing piece in OAS compared to MCP is that OAS does not have a discovery mechanism for the LLM to know which tools are available. This is where OAS v4 could shine, by adding a way for the LLM to discover the API spec and the available tools.</p>
<p>Imagine if OAS v4 had a way to describe the tools available in a way that the LLM could understand, and then the LLM could decide which tool to use, and how to use it. This would make it possible for any LLM to work seamlessly with RESTful APIs, without the need for a separate protocol like MCP, or even better, MCP could be used as a contract-first approach to AI tool integration, where the OAS v4 spec is the contract that defines the tools available, and the MCP server implements the backend logic. That's precisely what I have been advocating for a while now with my <a href="https://rebelion.la/you-dont-need-to-implement-mcp-servers-a-contract-first-approach-to-ai-tool-integration?showSharer=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contract-first approach to AI tool integration</a> and the <em>Headless API</em> (HAPI) initiative for MCP.</p>
<p>Now that I have explained how MCP works, and how OAS v4 could be the missing piece, I hope you can see the potential of OAS v4 for AI tool integration. But, don't stop here, next is what I would like to see in OAS v4.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-you-should-expect-in-oas-v4">What You Should Expect in OAS v4<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/oas-v4-is-out#what-you-should-expect-in-oas-v4" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What You Should Expect in OAS v4" title="Direct link to What You Should Expect in OAS v4" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>OAS v4 is not just an incremental update—it's an opportunity to rethink how APIs and AI tools work together. Here is what you should expect and advocate for in the next version, based on best practices and the needs of modern AI integrations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="modular-multi-file-api-specifications">Modular, Multi-File API Specifications<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/oas-v4-is-out#modular-multi-file-api-specifications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Modular, Multi-File API Specifications" title="Direct link to Modular, Multi-File API Specifications" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>You need modular specs for real-world APIs. OAS v4 should support multi-file specifications natively, allowing you to break down large APIs into smaller, reusable modules (for example, pets, users, orders). This approach enhances maintainability and collaboration across teams. Instead of a single massive file, you organize your API into logical domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Root:</strong> Main file with info, servers, and tags.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Dedicated files for OAuth2 and other schemes.</li>
<li><strong>Paths by Domain:</strong> Split endpoints into logical groups (e.g. <code>pet.api.yaml</code>, <code>user.api.yaml</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Components/Models:</strong> Reusable schemas separated by domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This modular structure keeps specs manageable (500–1000 lines each) and enables code generators and clients to see one unified spec. Tools like <a href="https://redocly.com/docs/cli/file-management#one-large-file-to-many-small-ones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redocly CLI</a> already offer splitting, but OAS v4 should standardize it. Modular specs also help AI tools (MCP servers) consume only the relevant modules, <strong>improving performance and reducing cognitive load for LLMs</strong> that may have context length limitations and make the LLMs' job easier when deciding which tools to use.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel development and reviews</li>
<li>Domain-specific clients (AI agents load only relevant modules)</li>
<li>Easier maintenance and updates</li>
<li>Improved collaboration</li>
<li>Better tooling support</li>
<li>Granular security schemes</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="well-known-tools-manifest-for-ai-discovery">Well-Known Tools Manifest for AI Discovery<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/oas-v4-is-out#well-known-tools-manifest-for-ai-discovery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Well-Known Tools Manifest for AI Discovery" title="Direct link to Well-Known Tools Manifest for AI Discovery" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>AI clients must discover available tools easily. OAS v4 should adopt a well-known URI convention (such as <code>/.well-known/mcp/tools-manifest.json</code>) so MCP clients and AI agents can auto-discover your API's tools. This follows patterns from <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenID Connect Discovery</a> and <a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.2.0.html#security-scheme-object" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OAuth 2.0 Security Scheme</a>. Give agents a predictable URL to learn your API—this small change pays off big in discoverability.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-first-annotations-and-metadata">AI-First Annotations and Metadata<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/oas-v4-is-out#ai-first-annotations-and-metadata" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AI-First Annotations and Metadata" title="Direct link to AI-First Annotations and Metadata" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>OAS v4 should introduce AI-first annotations to help clients and LLMs use APIs effectively. Add metadata extensions (such as <code>x-llm-hint</code>, <code>x-llm-example</code>) to endpoints, parameters, and responses. Use the <a href="https://spec.openapis.org/registry/tag-kind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>kind</code></a> property to categorize tags for AI relevance. For example:</p>

<p>With this approach, AI agents and MCP servers filter and discover only the endpoints relevant for tool calling, ignoring internal or non-AI endpoints. You can further extend this pattern with custom extensions:</p>

<p>By advocating for these features, you help shape OAS v4 into a standard that supports scalable, AI-ready APIs for the next generation of applications.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="example-conversion-openapi--mcp">Example: Conversion OpenAPI → MCP<a href="https://mcp.com.ai/oas-v4-is-out#example-conversion-openapi--mcp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Example: Conversion OpenAPI → MCP" title="Direct link to Example: Conversion OpenAPI → MCP" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Here is a simple example of how an OpenAPI spec can be converted to an MCP tools manifest.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petstore example</a> from Swagger, we can extract the relevant information to create an MCP tools manifest. Deploying an MCP server with the <a href="https://docs.mcp.com.ai/components/hapi-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>hapi</code> server</a>, we can extend the OpenAPI spec with AI-first annotations and modular structure.</p>
<p>In the demo below, the Petstore API is extended to integrate WorkOS for authentication, and the OpenAPI spec is modularized into separate files for better organization.</p>
